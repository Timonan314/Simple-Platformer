Just a simple (somewhat story based, I guess) platformer :)

You can use WASD to move, space to jump, and shift to do an air dash.

The story is just that you got a package delivered, but you fall into a hole on your way to go pick it up, which makes you do a bunch of platforming to get back up, on the other side, where your package is.
